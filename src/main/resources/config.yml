  # If a player is traveling straight, every 16 blocks traveled, they will generate or load the same amount of chunks as whatever your server render distance is set to.
  # If they are traveling at a 45-degree angle (perfectly diagonal), every 16 blocks traveled, they will generate your render distance multiplied by two.
  # These values must be tuned to how your server is configured. This default config is roughly tuned for a view distance of 5.
